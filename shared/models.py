class AbstractModel(models.Model):
    """
    An abstract base model that provides common fields for all models.

    Fields:
    - id (UUIDField): A unique identifier for each instance, automatically generated.
    - created_at (DateTimeField): The timestamp when the instance was created, set automatically.
    - updated_at (DateTimeField): The timestamp when the instance was last updated, updated automatically.

    This class is intended to be used as a base class for other models, providing a
    consistent structure for commonly used fields. As an abstract model, it will not
    create a separate database table.

    Meta:
        abstract (bool): Set to True, indicating this model is abstract.
